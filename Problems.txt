PROBLEMS

- figuring out how to change multiple css properties at once

- how to make changes in external CSS

- how querySelectorAll() and getElementByID() work ?

= querySelectorAll() is used with CSS selectors and getElementByID() is used with HTML elements 
= querySelectorAll() returns an Array, that's why we can't use that in this program. We have to use querySelector(), which returns a single value. This way, here we were able to used querySelector() and getElementById() interchangibly, as both were returning the same DOM element
